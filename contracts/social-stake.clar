;; SocialStake Protocol - Trust-Based Social Finance on Bitcoin
;;
;; Title: SocialStake - Decentralized Trust Networks with Economic Incentives
;;
;; Summary:
;; SocialStake revolutionizes social interaction by creating economically-backed
;; trust networks on Bitcoin's Layer 2. Members stake STX tokens to join exclusive
;; communities, earning reputation through positive interactions and governing
;; collective decisions through weighted voting mechanisms.
;;
;; Description:
;; Built on Stacks blockchain for Bitcoin-grade security, SocialStake introduces
;; a novel social finance paradigm where trust becomes quantifiable and reputation
;; becomes valuable. The protocol features stake-backed membership, reputation
;; mining through social interactions, decentralized governance with economic
;; incentives, automated escrow management, and transferable social capital.
;;
;; Key innovations include skin-in-the-game dynamics that align economic incentives
;; with social behavior, creating the first truly sustainable social network where
;; good actors are rewarded and bad actors face economic consequences. This bridges
;; the gap between social networks and decentralized finance on Bitcoin.
